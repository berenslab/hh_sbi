This repository contains the analysis code and the preprocessed data for the above manuscript.

## Raw data
Raw electrophysiological recordings can be publicly downloaded [here](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000008/draft) corresponding to a study published in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2907-3). Instructions on how to do so with `dandi` are also found there. Make sure you download the data in `./data/raw_data`.
<br>
You will also need `SmartSeq_cells_AIBS.pickle` in `./data/` that can be downloaded from [here](https://zenodo.org/record/5118962#.Y-IkqHbMIuU).
<br>
The rest of the (preprocessed) data can be found in `./data/`.

## Analysis and figures
### 1. Preprocess data
Run `./code/preprocess.ipynb` (optionally) to extract summary statistics of the raw electrophysiological recordings. Results can be found in `./code/pickles/M1_features.pickle`.

### 2. Build simulations
Run `./code/build_simulations.ipynb' to produce Hodgkin-Huxley model simulations.

### 3. Build amortized posteriors with neural posterior estimation.
Run `./code/build_amortized_posteriors.ipynb` to produce amortized posteriors.

## Requirements
- [dandi](https://dandiarchive.org/) (see `raw data`) <br>
- [pynwb](https://pynwb.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): `pip install -U pynwb` tested with version 2.2.0 <br> 
- [brian2](https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): `pip install brian2` tested with version 2.5.0.3 <br>
- [sbi](https://www.mackelab.org/sbi/reference/): `pip install sbi` tested with version 0.21.0 (this will also install torch) <br>
- [pathos](https://github.com/uqfoundation/pathos): `pip install pathos` tested with version 0.2.8 <br>
- [openTSNE](https://opentsne.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#conda): `pip install opentsne` tested with version 0.6.2 <br>
In case you would want to run additional regression analyses with sparse reduced-rank regression and [sparse bottleneck neural networks](https://github.com/berenslab/sBNN/) as done in `code/deploy_sRRR_and_sBNN/` and to produce `figures/figure_4.png` for instance you will need: <br>
- [glmnet_python](https://github.com/bbalasub1/glmnet_python/): `pip install glmnet_py`, and <br>
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/): `pip install tensorflow` tested with version 2.7.0. <br>
